# This is a very basic project I created as a final with React app that uses a great amount of Javascript.

It is a somewhat silly online storefront page that contains reactive elements and parts that change based on user input.
This project is by no means complex and is more of a basic foray into React App that I accomplished early on.

The webpage can be accessed here: https://amcdonaldstudent.github.io/5.3FinalProjectUpload/
